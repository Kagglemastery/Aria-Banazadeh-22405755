          <h1>
            Site Report
          </h1>
          Beginning with the homepage i put up a super quick bio and a pic of me. I added some animations to the navigation menu, which changes color when you hover over it. And, if you hover over my pic, it gets a little more see-through, adding a cool effect.

          Next up I did my portfolio page, This one's pretty simple but super clean. I used CSS grid to create a layout with three columns, each with a picture.I added the same effect with CSS:hover and transition.         
          
         After that I finished the contacts page. I created a simple form for people to get in touch with me, and I made sure to add some animations to make it stand out. When you hover over the form, the borders change color and there's a nice little shadow effect. And, when you hit the submit button, it opens your email so you can send an email with the subject and message you put in the form, using the mailit function discussed during the module!
          
          For the work experience page, I had to get a little creative. Since I don't have any real work experience, I made up some fake job titles and descriptions. I used CSS grid again to make a layout with two columns - one for the name of the company and date, and the other for the job title and description. 

          And finally, there's the "about" page. I don't have to explain this one. Overall, I'm thrilled with how my website turned out. It's mobile-friendly, so you can view it on any device. I had some issues with my laptop, so I did most of the coding in Notepad, and finally did teh commits and visual studio today after I got my laptop repaired, but I learned a ton about coding and debugging in the process. And, just to show off a little, I've attached a verification of the HTML and CSS codes. Thanks for checking out my website, hope you liked it!

          I had a good experience with the module. Even though I already had some background knowledge in web development, the module was extremely beneficial. It helped me revise and solidify my existing knowledge while also teaching me new things such as working with Git.
