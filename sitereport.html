            Site Report
          </h1>
         I just finished building my website and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. It's got five pages in total, each with its own unique layout and design. Let me walk you through what I've got going on here.
          

          First up is the homepage. I wanted to make sure people knew who was behind this website, so I included a photo of myself and a brief bio. To add a little bit of flair, I added some animations to the navigation menu - you'll notice that it changes color when you hover over it. And if you hover over my photo, the opacity changes, adding a cool effect.
          
          
          Next, there's the portfolio page. This one's pretty straightforward - I used CSS grid to create a layout with three columns, each containing a photo. I like how this turned out because it's easy to navigate and doesn't clutter up the page.
          
          The contact page is where things get a little more interesting. I created a simple form for people to get in touch with me, and I made sure to add some animations to make it stand out. When you hover over the form, the borders change color and there's a nice little shadow effect. And when you hit the submit button, it automatically sends an email to the address I specified using mailto.
          
          For the work experience page, I decided to get a little creative. Since I don't have any real work experience yet, I made up some fake job titles and descriptions. I used CSS grid again to create a layout with two columns - one for the name of the company and the date, and the other for the job title and description. It looks pretty slick, if I do say so myself.
          
          And finally, there's the page you're on right now - the "about" page. I don't really need to explain this one, do I?
          
          Overall, I'm really happy with how this website turned out. I made sure to make it mobile-friendly, so it should look good no matter what device you're using. The only downside was that I had some trouble with Visual Studio, so I ended up doing most of the coding in Notepad. But hey, I learned a lot about coding in the process, so I can't really complain.
          
          Oh, and one last thing - just to show off a little, I've attached a verification of the validity of the HTML and CSS codes. I take my coding seriously, what can I say?
          
          Thanks for checking out my website, hope you liked it!
